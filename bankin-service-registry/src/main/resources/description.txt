Here I’m setting custom port for this application without using the 8080 default port, In addition to that I’m setting custom URL for as 
the default zone otherwise, Eureka will use http://localhost:8761 as default zone.

Also I’m adding register-with-eureka: false, otherwise eureka will try to register this server as a client to itself by default config, 
This will be blocked with this property.

Then fetch-registry: false this is another config that coming as default true, Hence we needs to mark it as false when we are using this with eureka server,
 Otherwise it will try to fetch details about all the registered services from itself.
